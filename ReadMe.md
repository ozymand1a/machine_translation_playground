This repository provides a set of machine translation models under
pytorch lightning wrapping.

Basic Plan:
- [x] Write pytorch-lightning based pipeline
- [ ] Add 6 seq2seq models
- [x] Rewrite torchtext dataset in a convenient manner 
- [ ] Add custom dataset (not torchtext)
- [ ] Add omegaconf support
- [ ] Inference/translate
- [ ] Add metrics:
    - [ ] attention score
    - [ ] bleu
    - [ ] perplexity score
  
Advance:
- [ ] Write big transformer model with good quality
- [ ] Write chatbot or another api
- [ ] Make benchmarks
- [ ] Use knowledge distillation
- [ ] Add tutorials
- [ ] Make pretrain

Pro:
- [ ] Try to extend to framework
- [ ] Add docker support
- [ ] Use Enigma for other DS tasks
